AI Projects-

1. Sodoku - Build an agent which can solve sodoku using constraint propogation. Internally implements algorithms like elimination, only choice and naked twins to prune search space and arrive at a conclusion if possible.

2. Isolation - Build an agent to play the game of isolation. Uses minimax search with alpha beta pruning. Use of heurestics to improce search.

3. Planning - Build a domain independent planner. Again use heurestics to improve search. Compare differeent search algorithms and various heurestics.

4. Recognizer - Build a recognizer for American Sign Language
